## Linear Model

There is a very small data set 'mileage.csv'  on Sakai that shows car mileage versus car speed for a random sample of vehicles. Load the data set, conduct some exploratory analysis, obtain a least squares line for the data and check some associated diagnostics.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
cars <- read.csv("mileage.csv", header=TRUE)
cars

```

## Try quadratic model (we will do this in class)

```{r, eval=TRUE}

```
